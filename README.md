# C++ Workshop

## Pre-Workshop

Before the workshop, it's important to get gcc set up.
If you're on Linux, it's probably in your distro's repositories. A simple ``sudo apt install gcc g++`` should do.

If you're on mac, I reccomend you install brew (if you don't have it, [this](https://brew.sh) website will explain). From there just ``brew install gcc``.

If you're on windows, you can either install [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10), which is a virtual linux terminal, and then follow the Linux instructions, or follow [these instructions](https://geekstraw.com/compile-and-run-c-program-in-windows-10-using-command-prompt/)

I would also recommend making sure you have a decent text editor. If you
don't already have a favorite, some good examples include:

- GUI:
	- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
	- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- Terminal:
	- [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/)
	- [vim](https://www.vim.org/)

## Introduction

C++ is an object oriented, compiled language that acts as something of an addition to C. Because of this, all C code will compile in C++! So, if you know C, you already kind of know C++.
